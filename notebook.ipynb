{"cells":[{"source":"![A soccer pitch for an international match.](soccer-pitch.jpg)\n\nYou're working as a sports journalist at a major online sports media company, specializing in soccer analysis and reporting. You've been watching both men's and women's international soccer matches for a number of years, and your gut instinct tells you that more goals are scored in women's international football matches than men's. This would make an interesting investigative article that your subscribers are bound to love, but you'll need to perform a valid statistical hypothesis test to be sure!\n\nWhile scoping this project, you acknowledge that the sport has changed a lot over the years, and performances likely vary a lot depending on the tournament, so you decide to limit the data used in the analysis to only official `FIFA World Cup` matches (not including qualifiers) since `2002-01-01`.\n\nYou create two datasets containing the results of every official men's and women's international football match since the 19th century, which you scraped from a reliable online source. This data is stored in two CSV files: `women_results.csv` and `men_results.csv`.\n\nThe question you are trying to determine the answer to is:\n\n> Are more goals scored in women's international soccer matches than men's?\n\nYou assume a **10% significance level**, and use the following null and alternative hypotheses:\n\n$H_0$ : The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as men's.\n\n$H_A$ : The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is greater than men's.","metadata":{},"id":"3ed0edb2-696b-49ab-9db0-681defcce695","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Start your code here!\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pingouin\nfrom scipy.stats import mannwhitneyu\nwomen = pd.read_csv(\"women_results.csv\")\nmen = pd.read_csv(\"men_results.csv\") #convert to readable dataframe from csv for both\nprint(men.info())\nprint(women.info()) #find out the column names for each dataframe and datetype\nwomen[\"date\"] = pd.to_datetime(women[\"date\"])\nmen[\"date\"] = pd.to_datetime(men[\"date\"])#convert time for both men and women to datetime format since date is listed as object type\nwomen_sub = women[(women[\"date\"] > \"2002-01-01\") & (women[\"tournament\"].isin([\"FIFA World Cup\"]))]\nmen_sub = men[(men[\"date\"] > \"2002-01-01\") & (men[\"tournament\"].isin([\"FIFA World Cup\"]))] #filter datae for both subsets so that we see data for tournaments that occurred in the FIFA world cup and after the date of 2002-01-01\nwomen_sub['total_goals']= women_sub['home_score']+women_sub['away_score']\nmen_sub['total_goals']= men_sub['home_score']+men_sub['away_score'] #created new column that gave us the total goals of each match\nmen_sub[\"group\"] = \"men\"\nwomen_sub[\"group\"] = \"women\" #since we want to combine these two subsets together, we created a group in each subset that seperates the matches by men and women once combined\nmen_and_women = pd.concat([women_sub, men_sub], axis=0, ignore_index=True) #used .concat to combine the two subsets into one\nmen_and_women_sub= men_and_women[['total_goals', 'group']] #we only want total goals and group as we want to find out if average goals is higher, lower, or same depending on group men or women\nmen_and_women_wide = men_and_women_sub.pivot(columns= 'group', values='total_goals') #since the data is independent and unpaired, we will use wmw test. need to pivot data before we can do so. \nwmw_test = pingouin.mwu(x=men_and_women_wide['women'], y=men_and_women_wide['men'], alternative='greater')\nprint(wmw_test) #p value is less than the 0.1 significance level we created, heence we reject the null hypothesis\nresult_dict = {'p_val': 0.005107, \"result\": \"reject\"}\nprint(result_dict)","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":null,"lastExecutedAt":null,"lastExecutedByKernel":null,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":616,"type":"stream"}}},"id":"84a3c4c8-534b-4d1a-9919-17e05208b2ca","cell_type":"code","execution_count":50,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\nRangeIndex: 44353 entries, 0 to 44352\nData columns (total 7 columns):\n #   Column      Non-Null Count  Dtype \n---  ------      --------------  ----- \n 0   Unnamed: 0  44353 non-null  int64 \n 1   date        44353 non-null  object\n 2   home_team   44353 non-null  object\n 3   away_team   44353 non-null  object\n 4   home_score  44353 non-null  int64 \n 5   away_score  44353 non-null  int64 \n 6   tournament  44353 non-null  object\ndtypes: int64(3), object(4)\nmemory usage: 2.4+ MB\nNone\n<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\nRangeIndex: 4884 entries, 0 to 4883\nData columns (total 7 columns):\n #   Column      Non-Null Count  Dtype \n---  ------      --------------  ----- \n 0   Unnamed: 0  4884 non-null   int64 \n 1   date        4884 non-null   object\n 2   home_team   4884 non-null   object\n 3   away_team   4884 non-null   object\n 4   home_score  4884 non-null   int64 \n 5   away_score  4884 non-null   int64 \n 6   tournament  4884 non-null   object\ndtypes: int64(3), object(4)\nmemory usage: 267.2+ KB\nNone\n       U-val alternative     p-val       RBC      CLES\nMWU  43273.0     greater  0.005107 -0.126901  0.563451\n{'p_val': 0.005107, 'result': 'reject'}\n"}]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
